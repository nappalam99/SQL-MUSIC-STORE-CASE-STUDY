limit 1

2. Which countries have the most Invoices?

select billing_country,count(*) as most_bill from invoice
group by billing_country
order by most_bill desc

3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?

select * from invoice

limit 3

4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals

from invoice
group by billing_city
order by invoice_total desc

5. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money

select c.customer_id, round(sum(i.total))  as most_spent
from customer as c
inner join invoice as i
on c.customer_id = i.customer_id
group by c.customer_id
order by most_spent desc

Question Set 2 – Moderate
1. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A

select Customer.customer_Id,Customer.first_name,Customer.last_name,Customer.email
from Customer
 join invoice on Customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
 join invoice_line on invoice.invoice_id= invoice_line.invoice_id  
inner join track on track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
inner join genre on genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
where genre.name like 'Rock'
group by Customer.customer_Id
ORDER BY Customer.email

2. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands

select artist.name,artist.artist_id,count(artist.artist_id) as top_10_count
from artist
join album on artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
join track on album.album_id = track.album_id
join genre on track.genre_id = genre.genre_id
where genre.name like 'Rock'
group by artist.artist_id,artist.name,artist.artist_id
order by top_10_count desc
limit 10

3. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first

where milliseconds >
(select round(avg(milliseconds)) as avg_len from track)
order by milliseconds  desc

Question Set 3 – Advance
1. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent

select customer.customer_id,customer.first_name,customer.last_name,sum(invoice_line.quantity * invoice_line.unit_price) as total_price
from Customer
join invoice on invoice.customer_id = Customer.customer_id
join invoice_line on invoice_line.invoice_id = invoice.invoice_id
join track on track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
join album on album.album_id = track.album_id
join artist on artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
group by customer.customer_id,customer.first_name,customer.last_name
order by customer.customer_id

2. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres

with cte as (select customer.country,invoice.total,
row_number()over(partition by customer.country order by invoice.total desc ) high_country
from invoice
join customer on customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
join invoice_line on invoice_line.invoice_id = invoice.invoice_id
join  track on track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
join genre on genre.genre_id = track.genre_id)
select country,total
from cte
where high_country = 1
group by country,total
order by country

3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent.
 For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount

with cte as(select 
customer.first_name,customer.last_name,customer.country,invoice.total,
row_number()over(partition by customer.country order by invoice.total desc) as country_part
from customer
join invoice on invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
join invoice_line on invoice_line.invoice_id = invoice.invoice_id
join track on track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id)

select first_name,last_name,country,round(total) as total_spent_amount
from cte
where country_part = 1
